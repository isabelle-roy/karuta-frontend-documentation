<p>
	The Share metadata is used to allow the user to share part or all of their portfolio with a third 
	party. It is also possible to give this third party the right to edit shared elements. The user 
	shares his or her portfolio by clicking on a button, which triggers an email containing a hyperlink 
	to the shared elements to be sent to the third party.
</p>
<p>
	 User sharing enables two scenarios: 
	 
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>notify one of the portfolio users that they need to intervene;</li>
		<li>allow a user who does not currently have the rights to intervene in a portfolio to do so.</li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>In the Portfolio</h4>

<p>
	In this example, when the student clicks on "Request peer review", the system sends an email to the 
	peer with a hyperlink to a section of the portfolio in which they can enter their comment.

<p>
	There are multiple options for the security conditions of user sharing; here are some common use-cases:
</p>

<h4>
	Use case 1 &mdash; The student can show his or her portfolio to anyone (Karuta user or not) in read-only mode 
	(no edit rights).
</h4>
<p class='champ'>student,all,?,4,unlimited,Share@en</p>
<p>
	<b>Note 1:</b> Using the <code>?</code> symbol, the recipient is not predetermined by the designer; 
	when the student clicks on <i>Share</i>, a pop-up window will allow him or her to specify the recipient's 
	email.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Note 2:</b> The portfolio instance must be shared with the user <i>public</i> in the role <i>all</i>.
</p>

<h4>
	Use case 2 &mdash; The student can show his portfolio to anyone (Karuta user or not) in read-only mode <
	(no edit rights), but the sharing has a limited duration of 24 hours.
</h4>
<p class='champ'>student,all,?,4,24,Share@en</p>
<p>
	<b>Note 1:</b> Using the <code>?</code> symbol, the recipient is not predetermined by the designer; 
	when the student clicks on <i>Share</i>, a pop-up window will allow him or her to specify the recipient's 
	email.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Note 2:</b> The portfolio instance must be shared with the user <i>public</i> in the role <i>all</i>.
</p>

<h4>
	Use case 3 &mdash; The student requests for his or her teacher to proceed with their evaluation; the teacher 
	has a Karuta account and the student's portfolio is shared with said teacher in the <i>teacher</i>
	role.
</h4>
<p class='champ'>student,teacher,teacher,1,12,Request an evaluation@en</p>
<p>The teacher receives an email and clicks on the hyperlink it contains to proceed with the evaluation.</p>

<h4>
	Use case 4 &mdash; The student requests for his or her internship supervisor to proceed with their 
	evaluation; the internship supervisor does not have a Karuta account.
</h4>
<p class='champ'>student,supervisor,yves.lacoste@airfrance.com,3,12,Request an evaluation@en</p>
<p>
	The supervisor receives an email and clicks on the hyperlink it contains to proceed with the evaluation;
	the supervisor does not have to identify him or herself in Karuta. The hyperlink is valid for 12 hours.
</p>

<h4>
	Use case 5 &mdash; The student asks a peer to add a review in his or her portfolio; the colleague has a 
	Karuta account.
</h4>
<p>
<p class='champ'>student,peer,?,1,12,Request peer review@en</p>
<p>The peer receives an email and clicks on the hyperlink it contains to add his comment.</p>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Using the <code>?</code> symbol, the recipient is not predetermined by the designer; 
	when the student clicks on <i>Request peer review</i>, a pop-up window will allow him or her to specify 
	the recipient's email. It is assumed here that the student has a great number of peers and that the 
	designer did not specify which one will be mobilized, so as to give the student more latitude.
